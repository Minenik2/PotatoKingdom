Gameplay overview
	Hack n slash true enemies, parkour levels?
Primary Mechanics
	If u use powerup u lose life, NOT able to jump on enemies to kill them the player will have to use their weapon. 3 weapons, gun, melee sword, big sword  (hits slower, higher damage), boulders (too pass true the player has to use big sword), boulder enemies (to deal maximum damage the player has to use big sword), fast enemies that die to big sword,
Secondary Mechanics
	First sword is inherited, the player has to find the powerup to the gun and the big sword. Big sword powerup allows the player to progress further.
