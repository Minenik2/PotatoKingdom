Guy gonna get sword at the beginning of the game and then proceeds to slash

Story v0.1.0 - 
Potato kingdom is at war with vegetables, only the true potato prince can reunite the kingdom and make the vegetables live happy together in harmony, to do that the potato prince needs to stop pumpkin king he is evil.

Milad‚Äôs comments on story:
Added a reason for the potatoes to fight vegetables other than the pumpkins. In the revised version of the story other vegetables are taken captive, so it can be argued that the Pumpkin King is forcing them to work for him. 
Added a reason for why the Potato Prince is the chosen one 
‚ÄúSword in hand, his kingdom behind him, and the enemy in front, he became the hero of the vegetable continent. Sounds cool, doesn‚Äôt it? The Potato Prince took a step forward, and then another‚Ä¶‚Äù Ima be honest, I cooked a gourmet meal with this part. Would be sick imo if the backstory plays as text before the game starts, with emphasis on this part right before the game starts.

Also, if you guys are fine with the backstory playing at the start, I think it would be rlly cool to have some fitting art in the background for different parts of the backstory.
 Example: ‚ÄúLong ago, on a faraway continent, the vegetables lived together in harmony.‚Äù (art of vegetables happily coexisting),
 ‚ÄúHowever, one day the great ambitions of the Pumpkin King would put an end to the current status quo.‚Äù (art of evil pumpkin king),
 ‚ÄúMarching with his overwhelming army, the pumpkins destroyed the vegetable kingdoms in their path and took countless vegetables captive.‚Äù (art of pumpkins attacking other vegetables, kingdoms burning),
‚ÄúIn the end, only the Potato Kingdom remained to resist the Pumpkin King‚Äôs evil ambitions.‚Äù (art of potatoes on castle overlooking other kingdoms burn down) etc. 
I think this would be a great addition! Let me know if this is too much work or if you guys like the idea too üòÄ 


Story v0.1.1 -
Long ago, on a faraway continent, the vegetables lived together in harmony. However, one day the great ambitions of the Pumpkin King would put an end to the current status quo. Marching with his overwhelming army, the pumpkins destroyed the vegetable kingdoms in their path and took countless vegetables captive. In the end, only the Potato Kingdom remained to resist the Pumpkin King‚Äôs evil ambitions. The potatoes fought back valiantly, but it was only a matter of time before they too would succumb to the pumpkins‚Ä¶ All hope was not lost, however, as the Potato King had received a prophecy: 'Thou who fight evil, as the vegetables' last hope, I shall grant you words of wisdom. Your son is the key; he alone can defeat the Pumpkin King.' After hearing these words, the King, with a heavy heart, sent his son, the Potato Prince, to face the evil. Sword in hand, his kingdom behind him, and the enemy in front, he became the hero of the vegetable continent. Sounds cool, doesn‚Äôt it? The Potato Prince took a step forward, and then another...
